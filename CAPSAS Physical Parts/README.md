***Figure 1:** CAPSAS Dimensions and Frame*

The general structure of the CAPSAS is provided in Figure 1. Seven 36” and two 72” pieces of 1.5” square aluminum tubing are connected with metal brackets and 3D-printed parts to form the basis for which everything else is mounted. The 72” aluminum tubing was purchased with holes every 1 ½”, which is useful for the height adjustability of the system. Two pieces of the 36” tubing are used to form the base of the system and a 3D-printed [part](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/blob/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/STLs/Frame%20%26%20Hexagon%20Related%20Items/wheel%20cap%20v3.stl) is used to connect 4” casters to the tubing. Next, four [1.5” metal T brackets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B34HG1YD/) were used to connect the vertical 72” tubing. Additionally, 3D-printed brackets were used for the [bottom](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/blob/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/STLs/Frame%20%26%20Hexagon%20Related%20Items/t%20connector%20v4.stl) and [top](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/blob/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/STLs/Frame%20%26%20Hexagon%20Related%20Items/top%20elbow%20v3.stl) horizontal pieces of 36” aluminum to form the frame. Finally, an H-shaped piece of aluminum can be prepared by cutting two pieces of 36” aluminum in half and connecting them 9” away from the ends of another 36” piece with [brackets](https://www.amazon.com/Riuog-Brackets-Patterned-Bracket-Furniture/dp/B0B7N1QT6Z/). The H-shaped piece of aluminum holds the hexagons on the front of the CAPSAS through the blue brackets seen in Figure 1. The brackets were created in [three different sizes](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/tree/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/STLs/Frame%20%26%20Hexagon%20Related%20Items/Frame%20to%20Hexagon) to fit the hexagons to the front of the CAPSAS. It is connected to the metal frame through the height adjustment mechanism, seen in green in Figure 1.

***Figure 2:** Height Adjustment Mechanism*

The height adjustment mechanism was central to the CAPSAS because it allows our lab to collect data from various heights based on the shoulder height of the individual. A detailed look at the height adjustment mechanism is provided in Figure 2. It is composed of [several 3D-printed parts](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/tree/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/STLs/Frame%20%26%20Hexagon%20Related%20Items/Height%20Adjustment%20Mechanism) as well as a [spring](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Diameter-Stainless-Extended-Compressed/dp/B07MP9TDSH/) and [metal rod](https://www.amazon.com/YXQ-M6x180mm-Double-Adjustable-Stainless/dp/B07QPCWPXQ/) in each cylinder. An animation of the motion is also available in [this video](https://youtu.be/rhj-_HMj1IY).

***Figure 3:** Hexagon Layout*

All sixteen hexagons are constructed similarly to the one in Figure 3 using [laser cutting](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/tree/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/DXFs) (we laser cut acrylic but later had to cover the shiny surface with matte paper due to reflection issues with the VIVE motion trackers). Each has 12 addressable RGB LEDs constructed by soldering four pieces of 3 LEDs cut from a [30 LED per meter strip](https://www.amazon.com/SEZO-Individually-Addressable-Programmable-Non-Waterproof/dp/B097BX7P3V/) (as seen in brown in Figure 3). The order in which the LEDs are soldered is essential, as the controller calls them sequentially. Each hexagon has its own power wires due to the heavy power draw if all 192 LEDs were lit simultaneously, but the DIN comes from the DOUT of the previous hexagon. Also, each has an IR distance sensor (center of Figure 3) with its power wires and data out wire that goes back to the Arduino I/O (Figure 4). The red [part](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/blob/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/STLs/Objects%20%26%20Holders/new%20magnet%20back%20v3.stl) at the center of Figure 3 is two Halbach arrays of [square neodymium magnets](https://www.amazon.com/LOVIMAG-Neodymium-Magnets-Whiteboard-Science/dp/B0CP1N6432/). Such an array of powerful magnets is necessary to ensure the participant does not accidentally knock off any [object holders](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/tree/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/STLs/Objects%20%26%20Holders) on the front of the hexagon. The light blue, rounded rectangles in Figure 3 are [3D-printed parts](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/blob/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/STLs/Frame%20%26%20Hexagon%20Related%20Items/Frame%20to%20Hexagon/connector%20block%20v2.stl) that connect the hexagon to the brackets seen in Figure 1. Heat press inserts were used so the parts could easily be screwed into the frame. Finally, [diffusers](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/blob/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/STLs/Frame%20%26%20Hexagon%20Related%20Items/light%20diffuse%20v2.stl) were 3D-printed from white PLA to reduce the intensity of the LED light.

***Figure 4:** Arduino and Wiring*

All 16 hexagons are connected to an Arduino Mega. Additionally, due to the potential high-power demands of the LEDs and the sheer number of wires, two pairs of [power rails](https://www.amazon.com/Positions-Terminal-Pre-Insulated-Barrier-MILAPEAK/dp/B07CLW5FPS/) must be used to power the hexagons. The power rails and Arduino are mounted to the aluminum frame behind the hexagons using [3D-printed parts](https://github.com/LIMB-UCF/CAPSAS_Documentation/tree/main/CAPSAS%20Physical%20Parts/STLs/Frame%20%26%20Hexagon%20Related%20Items/Arduino%20Mount%20to%20Frame). Finally, a [12 V](https://www.amazon.com/R-Tech-UL-Listed-Switching-Supply-Adapter/dp/B00FEOB4EI/) and [5 V](https://www.amazon.com/JOVNO-Converter-100-240V-Transformer-5-5x2-5mm/dp/B08764XJ2M/) power supply are used to input the power for the Arduino and LEDs, respectively. The power supplies are then secured to one of the vertical pieces of aluminum.

A bill of materials (BOM) can be found in this folder. The estimated cost of building the CAPSAS is $1000 USD, assuming a 3D printer and common tools are available. The cost can be reduced if a laser cutter is available as well. Finally, the whole system also requires 4 VIVE motion trackers (around $500 USD) and an OyMotion gForcePro+ EMG armband (around $2800 USD).
