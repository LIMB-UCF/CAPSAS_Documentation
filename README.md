# Common Arm Position Signal Acquisition System (CAPSAS)
#### *Created by the Laboratory for Interaction of Machine and Brain (LIMB) at the University of Central Florida*

## Introduction
Surface electromyography (sEMG) is the leading method of non-invasive control of prosthetic hands. Using sEMG recorded over a short time window, machine-learning algorithms can be used to classify intended hand gestures with high accuracy if the training and testing data are collected when the arm’s location remains relatively the same. However, during activities of daily living (ADL), the arm position varies, deteriorating gesture recognition accuracy. Therefore, to systematically study how arm position influences hand gesture recognition, we have built a device to position subjects’ arms at different locations across two dimensions while recording sEMG and upper limb kinematics using motion trackers. Compared to existing methods, the innovative device improves the data collection process for upper limb prosthesis experiments. Since the system is automated, datasets can be collected with minimal experimenter interference. Additionally, since the system is open source, other laboratories worldwide can build similar systems to create standardized datasets. Such datasets, collected across participants and days, will provide invaluable insights for robust myoelectric control of prosthetic hands invariant to the limb position.
